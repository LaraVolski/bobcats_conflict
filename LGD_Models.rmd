# Modelling Dogs Using the Grid Survey Camera Dataset

# Step 1 - Set up a model with all the variables of interest.
full.model.lgd <- lmer(Count ~ Fire + Season + rugged81.clean + rugged121.clean + road.dist.clean + elevation.clean + slope.clean + vegetation.coarser.clean + Sheep_RAI + Sheep + Dog_RAI + Dogs_Scaled + (1|Camera),
                      data = subset.rai, na.action = "na.fail")

AIC(full.model.lgd) ## AIC is 5637.573
vif(full.model.lgd) ## Rugged81 has a slightly higher VIF, so I cut that one between the two ruggeds. Dogs_Scaled and Sheep_RAI were also cut based on which had the highest VIF.

reduced.model.lgd <- lmer(Count ~ Fire + Season + rugged121.clean + road.dist.clean + elevation.clean + slope.clean + vegetation.coarser.clean + Sheep + Dog_RAI + (1|Camera),
                      data = subset.rai, na.action = "na.fail")

AIC(reduced.model.lgd) ## AIC is 5626.776
vif(reduced.model.lgd) ## VIF under 4 for all

#Now, to dredge! First install and load the MuMIn package
install.packages("MuMIn")
library(MuMIn)
#Then dredging is as simple as...
dredge.reduced.model.lgd <- dredge(reduced.model.lgd)
```
# Part 2 - Model selection

Make candidate models and evaluate them!

## Null model/hypothesis - only camera as random effect.
AIC = 329.0
```{r}
fit.null <- glmer.nb(Count ~ offset(log(Operation)) + (1|Camera), data = subset.rai)
summary(fit.null)
```
